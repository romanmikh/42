## ðŸ§­ Overview

The Piscine at 42 School is an intensive programming trial and a crucial phase for admission into their programming courses. It is designed to test candidates' involvement capacity and to introduce them to the school's unique teaching methods. 

**Duration and Purpose**: The Piscine lasts four weeks, serving as the final stage before full admission to the 42 programming program. It's designed for both complete beginners and those with some programming experience. 

**Peer-to-Peer Learning**: Involving module-based exercises and peer evaluations to promote diverse learning perspectives.

**Curriculum and Training in C**: Regardless of prior coding knowledge, the Piscine starts with intensive training in the C programming language. This approach is part of the school's peer-to-peer learning, group work, peer-evaluation, and project pedagogy

**Machine Exams**: Weekly machine exams challenge candidates with increasingly difficult problems under time constraints, with no external help allowed. This is an opportunity for candidates to observe their progress and confront complex challenges

**Social and Collaborative Aspects**: The Piscine is not solely focused on work; it also includes events for candidates to socialize and bond. Candidates are often grouped into teams, leading to the formation of friendships and a supportive community
