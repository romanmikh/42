This is the first project after being accepted into the main 42 schol.

ftlib is a library of core C functions (recreated with the "ft_" prefix) that will be used and expanded on during the core curriculum. Only essential libraries (such as stddef, stdlib & limits.h) are allowed, all other lower level functions must be written from first principles and appended to ftlib.
